When looking at how much your claim will cost to take legal action versus the potential benefit to be gained in pursuing your claim, we consider things like: \n>The difficulty of the case. Cases which are \nmore difficult usually have greater legal costs\nattached to them.\n>The potential total value of the case. This includes the amount of damages you may be able to recover from the other party.\n>The non-financial value of the case. Sometimes your claim will have a benefit to you which is difficult to value in financial terms but is still worth pursuing. For these claims your \nappointed representative  will \ntake the benefit to you into account when calculating the total value of your claim.\n>If it would be reasonable to spend more in pursuing a claim than the benefit you would get in doing so.\nYour \nappointed representative  will assess the \npotential value to be gained in pursuing your case and the cost to take legal action.\nIf there are conflicting opinions about whether \nyour claim is likely to succeed, we\u2019ll ask you to get an expert opinion from a barrister.
